# Interactive Form

Interactive form project for Treehouse's FS-JS Techdegree

## What is this?

This is a form that uses Javascript to add interactivity. It is designed with progressive enhancement so it will work just fine with JS disabled.

JS handls form validation and hides/show different options based on the form's state. It's nothing too fancy but it was a good challenge to manage all the different states the form could be in.
